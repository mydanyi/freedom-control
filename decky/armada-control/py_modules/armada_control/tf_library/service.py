"""Read-only inspection and controlled start of one TF-card library conversion.

This is the TF backend migrated, behaviour unchanged, from the
mydanyi/armada-installer plugin (commit
1ac40b959085e6b55c2aef1467080b07560a2431), which is distributed under
GPL-3.0-or-later.  The copyright stays with the original author; the migrated
code is distributed here as part of this GPL-2.0 project with the copyright
holder's permission.  The fixed runtime and checkpoint paths and the
``armada-tf-library.service`` unit name are retained so both plugins share one
job state and a running conversion can be recovered after a restart.  Overlap
between two copies of *this* module is prevented by one shared lifecycle
``flock`` plus the unit-state check below; that is not an absolute guarantee,
because a legacy plugin build that never takes the lifecycle lock cannot be
forced to obey it.

The Decky process never touches a card itself.  ``inspect``/``prepare`` only
read state; the single mutation is a fixed ``armada-tf-library.service`` unit
handed to ``systemd-run`` after the caller confirms a previously prepared plan.
