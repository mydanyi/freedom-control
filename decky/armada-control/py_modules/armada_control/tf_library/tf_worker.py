"""Root worker that converts one TF card's reserve partition into a Steam library.

The plugin never touches a card itself.  ``TfLibraryService.start`` writes a
fixed plan record and hands ``armada-tf-library.service`` to ``systemd-run``;
that unit runs *this* file with the running interpreter and fixed argv, so the
conversion survives a Decky panel close or a plugin reload.  The worker:

* re-proves the physical card (SD/boot/critical guards, CID, GPT, filesystem
  UUID) immediately before every write, while holding the upstream
  ``/run/jupiter-automount-<reserve>.lock`` exactly once;
* unmounts only the reserve partition and refuses to format a busy one;
* retypes only ``p1`` to the Linux-filesystem GPT type (``sgdisk --typecode=1:8300``)
  and re-reads the GPT to prove the Android ``p2``/``p3`` are untouched;
* formats only the reserve partition (``mkfs.ext4 -F -E nodiscard -U <intended>
  -L ARMADA_TF_<cid6>``), where the intended UUID is generated and persisted in
  the validated checkpoint *before* anything is retyped or formatted;
* persists a durable checkpoint before formatting and after formatting so an
  interrupted run can resume without ever reformatting a verified ext4 reserve;
* mounts through the upstream automount helper, verifies the mount is the exact
  reserve ext4 mounted read-write, writes the Linux marker and creates the
  ``SteamLibrary/steamapps`` tree owned by UID 1000;
* asks a running Steam to add the library folder, and reports registration
  separately from the request (a CLI ``0`` is never treated as registration).

The module imports the package absolutely, adding the ``py_modules`` ancestor of
its own file (three directories up: ``tf_library`` -> ``armada_control`` ->
``py_modules``) to ``sys.path`` only when it is run as a direct script from an
arbitrary working directory, so it never depends on a relative import or on an
installed ``armada_installer`` distribution.
