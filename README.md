# Freedom Control

English | [简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

Freedom Control is a tablet-focused continuation of [Armada Control](https://github.com/armada-os/armada/tree/main/decky/armada-control), built for [ArmadaOS Freedom](https://github.com/mydanyi/armadaos-freedom). It is a Decky Loader plugin for controlling per-game and system-wide compatibility and performance settings on handheld and tablet devices.

This repository is the independent home of the project: <https://github.com/mydanyi/freedom-control>.

Freedom Control reuses the Armada Control plugin architecture and host-service interfaces, retains the original plugin directory and Python package names for compatibility, and adds an initial SoC-level profile layer for the SM8850 platform.

## Features

The current snapshot provides:

- **Per-game and global controls** for compatibility and performance settings, so a title can inherit the global configuration or override it individually.
- **Layered configuration** for shared, SoC-specific, and user profiles. Profile values can be defined once for all devices, refined per SoC, and overridden by the user.
- **Initial Lenovo Legion Tab Y700 Gen 5 (TB323FU, SM8850) support**, including an initial device/SoC profile with CPU frequency caps and core metadata.
- **CPU governor labels** in the interface, so the selected governor is shown with a readable name rather than only its kernel identifier.
- **TF card game library tab**, which turns the Linux reserve partition of a prepared TF card into a Steam game library without touching the card's Android storage.

SM8850 support is at the initial integration stage; performance tuning is ongoing.

## Repository layout

```
decky/armada-control/   Decky plugin: React/TypeScript frontend and Python backend
system_files/           Selected companion host-service and configuration sources
                        (an integration subset, retained in the upstream install layout)
tests/                  Focused SM8850 power-profile regression tests
```

- `decky/armada-control` is the plugin itself. It contains `main.py`, the `py_modules/armada_control` backend, the `src` frontend, and `plugin.json`.
- `system_files` mirrors the upstream filesystem layout (`usr/lib/armada`, `usr/libexec/armada`, `usr/share/armada`). It provides the companion host services and configuration that the plugin talks to. It is a source subset for OS integration, not an automatic installer and not a complete distribution.
- `tests/sm8850-power-test.py` covers the SM8850 power-profile layering and caps against the configuration sources in this repository.

The paths `decky/armada-control` and the Python package `armada_control` keep those upstream names for compatibility with existing Armada integration.

## Runtime requirements

Freedom Control is a plugin for an existing ArmadaOS or ArmadaOS Freedom installation. It requires:

- ArmadaOS or ArmadaOS Freedom, including its host services and power/device configuration, and
- [Decky Loader](https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/decky-loader).

Installing only the plugin does not install the companion components under `system_files`; those are part of the operating system image and must be integrated when the OS is built. This repository does not provide an automatic privileged deployment step.

## TF card game library

The **TF** icon tab turns the Linux reserve partition of a TF card into an Armada/Steam game library while keeping the card's Android storage. It sits between the optional fan/RGB tabs and the Advanced tab.

1. **On Android first.** Allocate the card with [Smart TF Card Allocator (智能TF卡分配器)](https://github.com/mydanyi/smart-tf-allocator) ([APK download](https://github.com/mydanyi/smart-tf-allocator/releases/latest)). The original Armada Installer plugin is not required.
2. **Insert the card and open the TF tab.** Rescan, select the card, then review.
3. **Confirm.** The dialog restates the card, the Linux reserve partition and both sizes; cancel changes nothing.

- Only the Linux reserve partition (p1) is formatted to ext4 and mounted. The Android metadata/private partitions (p2/p3) and their data are kept.
- A card that already holds an Armada library is mounted and reconnected to Steam without formatting; an existing ext4 card is never reformatted automatically.
- The page shows the real stage with an indeterminate progress bar, a details toggle, both success outcomes (connected to Steam vs. mounted and waiting for Steam), the retry-connect action that never formats, and failure/retry plus an explicit back-to-cards action.
- Card probing and status polling run only while the TF tab is open. Switching tabs or closing the panel unmounts the page and stops polling; the systemd conversion job keeps running, and reopening the panel resumes the running/succeeded/failed state.

Runtime requirements on the device: `systemd`; `util-linux` (`sfdisk`, `lsblk`, `findmnt`); `gdisk`/`sgdisk`; `e2fsprogs` (`mkfs.ext4`); `udev`; and `/usr/lib/hwsupport/steamos-automount.sh`.

## Development

Use Node.js 22.23.3 or Node.js 24 for development. From the repository root:

```sh
cd decky/armada-control
npm ci
npm test
npm run build
```

The build writes the frontend bundle to `dist/index.js` inside the plugin directory. A packaged plugin consists of `main.py`, `py_modules`, `plugin.json`, and `dist/index.js`.

The SM8850 regression suite uses only the Python 3 standard library. From the repository root:

```sh
python3 tests/sm8850-power-test.py
```

## Steam preset identifiers

Native Steam performance preset identifiers remain `Eco`, `Balanced`, and `Performance`. They are kept as-is for compatibility with Steam and with the host services. A display-only translation layer for these identifiers is not included in this snapshot.

## Source and license

Freedom Control is derived from Armada Control by the Armada project. Credit for the original plugin, host services, and configuration belongs to the Armada contributors. Freedom-specific modifications, including the SM8850 configuration layering and CPU frequency caps plus the rename and governor labels, come from [mydanyi/armadaos-freedom](https://github.com/mydanyi/armadaos-freedom).

The source snapshot is based on [commit `5c560b965d040c07cc76e4a3dd78afaba3fcc796`](https://github.com/mydanyi/armadaos-freedom/tree/5c560b965d040c07cc76e4a3dd78afaba3fcc796/decky/armada-control), together with the existing Freedom Control modifications noted above.

The TF card game library page is ported from [Armada Installer](https://github.com/mydanyi/armada-installer) (`1ac40b959085e6b55c2aef1467080b07560a2431`); the original author and source are retained. Its system-install page, language selector and author panel were not migrated, and the ported TF code is distributed as part of this project under the GNU General Public License v2.0 with the original author's approval.
